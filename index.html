    <p>Heres a list of things I like </p>
    
<ul> 
  <li>Horror Movies</li>
  <li>Margaritas</li>
  <li>Tv, Film, and reading</li>
</ul>


<p>My two favorite genres are horror and comedy. I like to watch either of those genres on film or tv while I drink wine and snack on chips and queso.I also I love taking long showers, and other forms of self care. I enjoy fine dinning and also getting take out and watching tv or a movie while I eat. I love planning trips and traveling. I also like reading horror and fantasy books.</p>

<p>I visit this site <a href="https://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a> to learn about directors, actors, actresses, and other filmography.</p>
